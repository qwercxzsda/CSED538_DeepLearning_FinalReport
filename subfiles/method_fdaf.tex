Although DDPM-cd demonstrates sufficiently good performance, it does not leverage the characteristics of bi-temporal images. Specifically, it involves feeding the differences between the features obtained from diffusion model into the Change Detection Network (Classifier) without considering the noise caused by the conditions when the two images were captured. Therefore, there could be an attempt to first eliminate these noise. To achieve this, we use method proposed by ChangerEx in \ref{fig:baseline_with_fdaf}, called Flow dual-alignment fusion.\cite{fang2023changerex} This technique involves generating two sets of features obtained from diffusion model and subsequently applying convolution based network, Flownet, and warping before feeding them into the Change Detection Network. By doing so, it applies image warping, which reduces noise errors between the two images.
